# FastAPI Learning Repository 🚀

This repository contains everything I am learning about **FastAPI**, including setup, core concepts, examples, and small experiments as I progress.

### 🎯 Goals of this repository
- Track my learning journey 📈  
- Build a strong backend foundation using FastAPI  
- Maintain consistency through regular commits

## 🛠️ Step 1: Initialize a Virtual Environment

 - Open **Command Prompt** in your project directory and run:

   py -3 -m venv venv

This will create a virtual environment named venv.
 
 - Activate the virtual environment:

   venv\Scripts\activate.bat

After activation, you should see (venv) in your terminal.

## 📦 Step 2: Install FastAPI
Install FastAPI along with all optional dependencies (as used in the tutorial):

pip install fastapi[all]

This installs:
 - FastAPI core framework
 
 - Uvicorn ASGI server

 - Optional tools such as:

 - HTML templates

 - File uploads

 - WebSockets

 - Validation & utility packages

## 🚀 Step 3: Create a Basic FastAPI App
Next steps in this repository will include:

 - Creating a basic FastAPI application

 - Running the server using Uvicorn

 - Exploring

 - Routing

 - Request & response models

 - Dependencies

📌 Progress & Updates
I will keep updating this repository as I continue learning and experimenting with FastAPI.

Stay tuned 🚀
